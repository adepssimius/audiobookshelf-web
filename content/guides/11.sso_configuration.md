# Introduction

This guide discusses the necessary configurations for SSO with OIDC in the server settings and provides some example configurations.

# Bypassing SSO Redirect

In the case of a misconfiguration or an issue with SSO, it may be helpful to bypass SSO in favor of local login. Local login is possible while SSO redirect is enabled by manually navigating to `https://your.audiobookshelf.instance.com/login/?autoLaunch=0`

# Configuring Audiobookshelf for SSO

Navigate to `Settings > Authentication`, then select the check box for `OpenID Connect Authentication`.

## Auto-populate with OIDC Discovery

Audiobookshelf is able to automatically populate many of the fields required for OIDC using the OIDC discovery endpoint. Simply enter the URL for your OIDC provider or the URL for the discovery endpoint in the `Issuer URL` box and click the `Auto-populate` button. 

Example URLs:
- `https://my.oidc.provider.com/`
- `https://my.oidc.provider.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`

You will still need to provide the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`, as these are unique to Audiobookshelf and are not provided with OIDC discovery.

## Additional Configuration
### Configuring Client ID and Client Secret
The Client ID and Client Secret function as a username and password for audiobookshelf to use with your OIDC provider. They must be generated or defined with your OIDC provider prior to use in audiobookshelf.

### Remaining Configuration Items

|  Field | Required | Example | Description  |
|---|---|---|---|
|  Issuer URL |  yes | https://your.oidc.instance.com  |  The URL which uniquely identifies an OIDC instance. The OIDC provider must know itself as this URL.  |
| Authorize URL  | yes  |  https://your.oidc.instance.com/api/oidc/authorization |    |
|  Token URL |  yes | https://your.oidc.instance.com/api/oidc/token  |   |
|  Userinfo URL | yes  | https://your.oidc.instance.com/api/oidc/userinfo  |   |
|  JWKS URL | yes  | https://your.oidc.instance.com/jwks.json  |   |
|  Logout URL | no  | https://your.oidc.instance.com/logout  |   |
|  Client ID | yes  |  `audiobookshelf` |   |
|  Client Secret | yes  | `0123abcdefgHIJKLMNOP.,!@$%^*?<`...  |  The "password" that audiobookshelf uses to authenticate with the OIDC provider. Authelia shares an [overview of good practices](https://www.authelia.com/integration/openid-connect/frequently-asked-questions/#how-do-i-generate-client-secrets) |
|  Button Text |  no | `Login with Google`  |  Hint to the user what OIDC provider is used. If nothing is specified defaults to `Login with OpenID` |
|  Match existing users by |   |   |   |
|  Auto Launch |   |   |   |
|  Auto Register |   |   |   |


# Configuring Your OIDC Provider

The steps needed to configure an OIDC provider will vary depending on which OIDC provider you choose. Example configurations are included below for your reference.

## Authelia

Configuring Authelia as an OIDC provider is covered well in the [authelia docs](https://www.authelia.com/configuration/identity-providers/open-id-connect/) The sample configuration below only includes the details required to configure Audiobookshelf as a client:

``` yaml
identity_providers:
  oidc:
    # See the Authelia documentation for additional configuration required to get OIDC working. Only the audiobookshelf client configuration is included here
    # https://www.authelia.com/configuration/identity-providers/open-id-connect/
    clients:
      - id: audiobookshelf # this must match the client id provided to audiobookshelf
        description: "Audiobookshelf"
        secret: 'your_client_secret' # this must match the client secret provided to audiobookshelf
        redirect_uris:
          - https://your.audiobookshelf.instance.com/auth/openid/callback
        scopes:
          - openid
          - profile
          - email
```
